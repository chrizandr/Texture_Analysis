I wrote the code for Gabor and GSCM features. Me and Santhu both ran it on the entire dataset by splitting it into parts.
I later wrote a code and separated the features according to the listings below. Simple code to separate columns.
Santhu is working on skeletonization and junction detection. Initial plan is to extract texture based and spatial based features and later compare and combine the two.
Santhu is done with skeletonization but is finding it difficult to do junction detection.
Trying to figure out which features are the best using Gabor and GSCM based features on full document images if the IAM dataset.
Experimenting with each of them individually in the order:
Gabor[4,8,16,32,all]
GSCM[1,2,3,4,5,all]

Ranking them separately using NNC:

Gabor_4 :  34.243  %
Gabor_8 : 27.6803 %
Gabor_16 :  29.3047 %
Gabor_32 :  26.2508 %
Gabor_all : 35.0877 %

GSCM_1 : 29.8246 %
GSCM_2 : 30.1494 %
GSCM_3 : 31.0591 %
GSCM_4 : 31.0591 %
GSCM_5 : 31.2541 %
GSCM_all : 31.1891 %

We observe that combining all the Gabor features gives us the best results.

We try the same experiments on the features after applying Fischer linear discriminant analysis to reduce the feature vector

Gabor_4_LDA : 49.3827 % INCREASED
Gabor_8_LDA : 45.4191 % INCREASED
Gabor_16_LDA : 44.3795 % INCREASED
Gabor_32_LDA : 44.2495 % INCREASED
Gabor_all_LDA : 55.0357 % INCREASED

GSCM_1_LDA : 24.7563 % REDUCED
GSCM_2_LDA : 27.7453 % REDUCED
GSCM_3_LDA : 24.7563 % REDUCED
GSCM_4_LDA : 22.742  % REDUCED
GSCM_5_LDA : 23.5218 % REDUCED
GSCM_all_LDA : 31.1891 % SAME                                                                                                           ``````````````

Again we observe that combining all the Gabor features gives us the best results.
We also observe that the GSCM features actually reduce performance when combined with FLDA.

We now select the worst results and see if we can improve them using PCA
GSCM_1 : 25.8609 % FAIL
GSCM_all : 25.8609 % FAIL

It is observed that GSCM features do not improve performance when applying FLDA or PCA
Conclusion: NOT A GOOD FEATURE

Gabor accuracy almost doubles when FLDA applied.
Trying to improve using PCA

Only PCA:
Gabor_4: 30.1494 % REDUCED
Gabor_8:  23.3918 % REDUCED
Gabor_16:  21.7024 % REDUCED
Gabor_32: 21.7024 % REDUCED
Gabor_all: 27.2904 % REDUCED

PCA then FLD:
Gabor_4: 30.2144 % REDUCED
Gabor_8:  23.5867 % REDUCED
Gabor_16: 21.4425 % REDUCED
Gabor_32: 21.4425 % REDUCED
Gabor_all: 26.5757 % REDUCED

FLD then PCA:
Gabor_4: 46.1988 % No Significant loss
Gabor_8: 44.0546 % No Significant loss
Gabor_16: 43.3398 % No Significant loss
Gabor_32: 43.2749 % No Significant loss
Gabor_all: 54.6459 % No Significant loss

PCA causes loss of classification success, but FLD + PCA does not cause much losses.

Will try combinations later as I don't have the combined csv and arff files generated for the features.
