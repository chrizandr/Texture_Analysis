We have put junction detection on hold and have decided to take a different approach.
The plan is to extract various texture based features, pool them together and extract the best ones to differentiate.
Santhu has finished writing code for the Edge Directional features and has run it on the entire dataset.
She extracted feature in 8, 12, 16 directions each. She later differentiated the 16 feature vector to get a 15 feature vector
Used my code to separate them from the combined results.
Running tests to find out which ones are the best.

The files are:
Edge[8,12,16,15,all]
Edge_LDA[8,12,16,15,all]

Ranking them using NNC:
Edge_8 : 40.6758 %
Edge_12 : 55.4256 %
Edge_16 : 55.9454 %
Edge_15 : 60.1689 %
Edge_all : 61.9883 %

We observe that combining all the features gives the best results.
Trying FLDA on the files and seeing if there is an improvement
Ranking them:
Edge_8 : 43.7947 %
Edge_12 : 50.6173 %
Edge_16 : 59.1943 %
Edge_15 : 68.4211 %
Edge_all : 61.2736 %

Trying only PCA
Edge_8 :
Edge_12 : 47.1735 %
Edge_16 :
Edge_15 :
Edge_all :
